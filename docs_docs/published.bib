  abstract = {With the success of large-scale pre-training
and multilingual modeling in Natural Language Processing (NLP), recent years have
seen a proliferation of large, web-mined
text datasets covering hundreds of languages.
However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of these publicly
available datasets, or whether the datasets
actually contain content in the languages
they claim to represent. In this work, we
manually audit the quality of 205 languagespecific corpora released with five major public datasets (CCAligned, ParaCrawl, WikiMatrix, OSCAR, mC4), and audit the correctness
of language codes in a sixth (JW300). We
find that lower-resource corpora have systematic issues: at least 15 corpora are completely
erroneous, and a significant fraction contains
less than 50% sentences of acceptable quality.
Similarly, we find 82 corpora that are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous language
codes. We demonstrate that these issues are
easy to detect even for non-speakers of the languages in question, and supplement the human
judgements with automatic analyses. Inspired
by our analysis, we recommend techniques to
evaluate and improve multilingual corpora and
discuss the risks that come with low-quality
data releases.}

    abstract = "Research in NLP lacks geographic diversity, and the question of how NLP can be scaled to low-resourced languages has not yet been adequately solved. {`}Low-resourced{'}-ness is a complex problem going beyond data availability and reflects systemic problems in society. In this paper, we focus on the task of Machine Translation (MT), that plays a crucial role for information accessibility and communication worldwide. Despite immense improvements in MT over the past decade, MT is centered around a few high-resourced languages. As MT researchers cannot solve the problem of low-resourcedness alone, we propose participatory research as a means to involve all necessary agents required in the MT development process. We demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of participatory research with a case study on MT for African languages. Its implementation leads to a collection of novel translation datasets, MT benchmarks for over 30 languages, with human evaluations for a third of them, and enables participants without formal training to make a unique scientific contribution. Benchmarks, models, data, code, and evaluation results are released at https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-mt.",
