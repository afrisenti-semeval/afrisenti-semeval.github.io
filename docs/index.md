## **Motivation**

Due to the widespread use of the Internet and social media platforms, most languages are becoming digitally available. This allows for various artificial
intelligence (AI) applications that enable tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, hateful content detection, among others. According to UNESCO (2003), 30% of all living languages, around 2,058, are African languages. However, most of these languages do not have curated datasets for developing such AI applications. Recently, various individual and funded initiatives, such as the Lacuna Fund, have set out to reverse
this trend and create such datasets for African languages. However, research is required to determine both the suitability of current natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the development of novel techniques to maximize the applications of such datasets. We believe that SemEval is the right venue, due to its popularity and widespread acceptance, to carry out shared tasks in these African languages to strengthen their further development.

In this shared task, we have covered 13 African languages, namely 4 languages from Nigeria ([Hausa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_language), [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language), [Igbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_language), [Nigerian Pigdin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Pidgin)), 2 from Ethiopia ([Amharic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic) and [Tigrinya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigrinya_language)), [Swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language) from Kenya and Tanzania,  [Algerian Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_Arabic) dialect from Algeria, [Tunisian Arabizi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_Arabic) from Tunisia, [Kinyarwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinyarwanda), [Twi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twi) from Ghana, and 2 languages from South Africa ([isiZulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_language), [Setswana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tswana_language)). We are also working on adding more languages to the shared task.



## **Task Overview**

Previous shared tasks on different aspects of sentiment analysis includes <cite>Nakov et al., (2016), Pontiki et al., (2014), Ghosh et al., (2015)</cite> and so on. However, none of these tasks have covered African languages. The AfriSenti-SemEval shared task is based on a collection of Twitter datasets in 12 African languages for sentiment classification.

The **AfriSenti-SemEval Shared Task 12** consists of three sub-tasks. Participants can select one or more tasks depending on their preference. 

> **Task A: Monolingual Sentiment Classification**

> Given training data in a target language, determine whether an instance of tweet in that language is positive, negative, or neutral

> **Task B: Sentiment  Multilingual Sentiment Classification**

Given a combined training data from 10 African languages, determine whether a tweet instance in any of the given languages is positive, negative, or neutral.

> **Task C: Zero-Shot Sentiment Classification**

Given unlabeled tweets in two African languages (Tigrinya and Kinyarwanda), leverage any or all of the available training datasets in Subtasks 1 and 2 to determine whether an instance of a tweet in the two target languages is positive, negative, or neutral.

## **Dataset Examples**

The dataset involves tweets labeled with three sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral) in 12 African languages. Each tweet is annotated by three annotators. We use a form of majority vote to determine the sentiment of the tweet. See more in our paper (<cite>Muhammad et al., 2022</cite>, <cite>Yimam et al., 2020</cite>).
 Below is a sample dataset for the 4 Nigerian languges (Muhammad et al., 2022):
