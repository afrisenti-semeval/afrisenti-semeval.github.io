This allows for various artificial intelligence (AI) applications that enable tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, hateful content detection, among others. According to UNESCO (2003), 30% of all living languages, around 2,058, are African languages. However, most of these languages do not have curated datasets for developing such AI applications. Recently, various individual and funded initiatives, such as the Lacuna Fund, have set out to reverse this trend and create such datasets for African languages. However, research is required to determine both the suitability of current natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the development of novel techniques to maximize the applications of such datasets. We believe that SemEval is the right venue, due to its popularity and widespread acceptance, to carry out shared tasks in these African languages to strengthen their further development. In this shared task, we have covered 13 African languages, namely 4 languages from Nigeria ( Hausa , Yoruba , Igbo , Nigerian Pigdin ), 2 from Ethiopia ( Amharic and Tigrinya ), Swahili from Kenya and Tanzania, Algerian Arabic dialect from Algeria, Tunisian Arabizi from Tunisia, Kinyarwanda , Twi from Ghana, and 2 languages from South Africa ( isiZulu , Setswana ). We are also working on adding more languages to the shared task. Task Overview Previous shared tasks on different aspects of sentiment analysis includes Nakov et al., (2016), Pontiki et al., (2014), Ghosh et al., (2015) and so on. However, none of these tasks have covered African languages. The AfriSenti-SemEval shared task is based on a collection of Twitter datasets in 12 African languages for sentiment classification. The AfriSenti-SemEval Shared Task 12 consists of three sub-tasks. Participants can select one or more tasks depending on their preference. Task A: Monolingual Sentiment Classification Given training data in a target language, determine whether an instance of tweet in that language is positive, negative, or neutral Task B: Sentiment Multilingual Sentiment Classification Given a combined training data from 10 African languages, determine whether a tweet instance in any of the given languages is positive, negative, or neutral. Task C: Zero-Shot Sentiment Classification Given unlabeled tweets in two African languages (Tigrinya and Kinyarwanda), leverage any or all of the available training datasets in Subtasks 1 and 2 to determine whether an instance of a tweet in the two target languages is positive, negative, or neutral. Dataset Examples The dataset involves tweets labeled with three sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral) in 12 African languages. Each tweet is annotated by three annotators. We use a form of majority vote to determine the sentiment of the tweet. See more in our paper ( Muhammad et al., 2022 , Yimam et al., 2020 ).

Participants can work on any or all the subtasks. The Participants can form a team with multiple people or a single person team is okay. The participants can experiment with the training data to develop models. Usage of any external data or resource is allowed and highly encouraged. This process can run till the evaluation period. Evaluation period: Organisers will release the test set containing instances without the labels. The participants will use their developed models to predict the labels for the instances and they have to create a submission file that follows exactly the same format of the training data. These prediction files should be submitted to Codalab submission portal (will be announced later). These predictions will be compared against the ground truth labels of the test data and the teams will be ranked on a leaderboard according to the performance score. Each team is encouraged to write a system description paper describing their submission system, analysis of their results, interesting insights and submit before date. Paper submission procedure will be announced later. After a review period, each team has to update their submitted paper based on the review feedback and submit the camera ready version. Accepted papers will be published as part of the proceedings of SemEval 2023 Workshop (link).

Twitter has a strong policy for public distribuition of user data and allow only sharing of TweetsIDs. Therefore, we will not be able to provide the full text of the tweets. Instead, we will realese the dataset with the following metadata for each language: tweet ids and the annotation labels. Below is an example of the dataset. tweetIDs labels 1329755580903415808 negative 1387857032523489280 negative 1177449493844787200 positive 1082503529007403008 neutral We will provide a script to allow hydrating all the tweets in our dataset. Check the Github repository for more details. Sample Data We provide a sample dataset for the shared task. Check the Github repository . Baseline We provide baseline based on the following two papers: Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad, David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Sebastian Ruder, Ibrahim Said Ahmad, Idris Abdulmumin, Bello Shehu Bello, Monojit Choudhury, Chris Chinenye Emezue, Saheed Salahudeen Abdullahi, Anuoluwapo Aremu, Alipio Jeorge, Pavel Brazdil. 2022, NaijaSenti: A Nigerian Twitter Sentiment Corpus for Multilingual Sentiment Analysis, Marseille, France Seid Muhie Yimam, Hizkiel Mitiku Alemayehu, Abinew Ayele, Chris Biemann. 2020: Exploring Amharic Sentiment Analysis from Social Media Texts: Building Annotation Tools and Classification Models, Barcelona, Spain (Online) Submission Website We will be accepting and evaluating your submissions on CodaLab . The submission page will be available soon! Evaluation We will use the AvgRec, Accuracy, and macro-average F1 measures for model evaluation. AvgRec, which provides results in a range of [0,1] favoured over standard accuracy because it is more robust to class imbalance (usually more natural classes than positive or negative as it can be seen in our Amharic dataset class distribution). Although accuracy reports the overall performance of the system, the F1 metric is calculated over the POSITIVE and the NEGATIVE classes exclusively.
