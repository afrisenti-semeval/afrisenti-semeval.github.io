# Competition Dataset

The dataset for the competition is available at the following Github link: [AfriSenti-SemEval Dataset](https://github.com/afrisenti-semeval/afrisent-semeval-dataset)


The dataset consists of tweets labeled with three sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral) in 12 African languages. Each tweet is annotated by three annotators. We use a form of majority vote to determine the sentiment of the tweet. See more in our paper: Below is a sample dataset in all the languages:
